## Notes & Assumptions

* ðŸ“Œ A book (by `bookId`) can be borrowed by only **one borrower at a time**
* ðŸ“Œ Multiple physical copies of the same ISBN are stored as separate `Book` entries with unique IDs
* ðŸ“Œ Validation ensures:

    * `@NotBlank` name
    * `@Email` format for email
* ðŸ“Œ Error responses follow consistent structure and use `ResponseEntity` for status codes
